        Welcome to TableCloth.\n\nOur audience is anyone that cooks or wants to cook. We also have a portion of our app that is tailored towards college kids as sometimes we donâ€™t have time to figure out what we want to make.\n\nThe fridge database solves this issue as we can auto-find recipes based on what we currently have. If someone wants to know a recipe for a food that they find interesting, they can take a picture of it and then they have the recipe for future reference.</string>
